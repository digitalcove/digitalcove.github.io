Welcome. We're glad that you're here. How can we help you today?

In today's interconnected world, the digital footprint of every family
is constantly expanding. It seems like we have more devices, more
apps, more photos, more emails, and more accounts every day.

A multitude of technology options and concerns bombard us constantly -
whenever we read about yet another internet security breach; hear
about the latest app that "the kids these days" are using from another
parent; or when we need to decide whether the newest gadget is worth
investing in, or our old gadgets need updating.

The barrage of information and options can be overwhelming, even when
we consider ourselves tech savvy and have been using variants of these
technologies for our entire lives.

experiment with how best to make online connections. You value the

ways, but you worry how all the threads will fit into a big
picture.

the lines.*
